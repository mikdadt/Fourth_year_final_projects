# Fourth_year_final_projects

The following are my final projects for my fourth year Physics Lab coures at the University of Toronto.

For my electronics lab, my partner and I built a guitar distortion circuit, that distorts guitar input via soft clipping. The circuit also has an equalizer (a band pass filter for the bass and treble frequency ranges) as well as a volume control.

For my time series analysis code, I analyse Covid-19 data (positive cases, hospilizations and vaccinatoins) from 2021.
