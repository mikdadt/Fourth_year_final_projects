#Time Series Analysis Final Project (Covid-19 Data)

The following is code and report for my final project for PHY408 Time Series Analysis, at the University of Toronto. The objective of this project was to analyse Covid-19 data in Ontario from 2021. The data being compared is positive case numbers, hospitilization and vaccinations.

The code is currently in need of much refinement; the project only required the report and so the code has not been neatened up. Cummalative vaccination data and case numbers also needs to be quantataively analysed. I aim to
 apply these improvements throughout this summer.
